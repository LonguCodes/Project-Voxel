<h1> Project Voxel </h1>

Project Voxel is a engine for Unity that allows making voxel-based game easier and with better optimisation than naive approach.
The project was made solely on stream, which you can find here: https://www.twitch.tv/longucodes and rewatch here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4fnPCshedWpbVGc3UPCQeg

<h2> Base Idea </h2>

The think that makes the project worthwhile agains naive approach (just spawning cubes) is more optimised count of faces and verticies, better customizability and ease of use.

<h2> Features </h2>

<ul>
  <li> Voxel state management </li>
  <li> Control over the amount of updates </li>
  <li> Automatic texture map creation </li>
  <li> Automatic type registration </li>
  <li> Ability to customize rendering of every voxel </li>
  <li> Optimized neighbour checking </li>
 </ul>
